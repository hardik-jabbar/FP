# FarmPower - Next Steps for Development (Post-MVP)

This document outlines the recommended next steps for the FarmPower platform following the successful development, launch, and initial feedback phase of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). These steps are aimed at enhancing the platform's capabilities, addressing technical debt, and moving towards the features outlined in the `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`.

## Phase 1: Immediate Post-MVP Priorities (Iteration 1.1)

This phase focuses on stabilizing the MVP, incorporating initial user feedback, and implementing high-value, relatively low-effort improvements.

### 1.1. MVP Stabilization & Feedback Incorporation
*   **Monitor MVP Performance:** Closely track success metrics (user adoption, engagement, system stability).
*   **Gather User Feedback:** Actively solicit and analyze feedback from early MVP users.
*   **Bug Fixing:** Prioritize and address any critical bugs or usability issues identified in the MVP.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Address any immediate performance bottlenecks observed.

### 1.2. Foundational Technical Enhancements
*   **Confirm Supabase JWT Validation in Backend:**
    *   Ensure robust and secure validation of Supabase-issued JWTs in `farmpower_backend_v2` for all protected API routes. Implement if not fully in place.
*   **Clarify and Standardize Server Setup:**
    *   Officially deprecate or repurpose `FARMPOWER/app.py` (Flask) and `FARMPOWER/server.js` (Node/Express) if they are not part of the main deployment strategy (which uses `farmpower_backend_v2` to serve the frontend). Update documentation accordingly.
    *   Ensure development environment setup instructions are clear and reflect the chosen stack.
*   **Improve Image Handling for Marketplaces:**
    *   Implement direct image uploads to AWS S3 (as indicated by backend config and roadmap) for tractor listings, replacing the MVP's URL input method.
    *   This includes frontend UI for file selection and upload, and backend logic for handling multipart/form-data and S3 storage.
    *   _Depends on: AWS S3 setup and credentials._

### 1.3. High-Value Feature Enhancements
*   **Password Reset Functionality:**
    *   Implement a secure password reset mechanism (e.g., email-based token system). This is a critical feature for user account management.
    *   _Components: Supabase auth might offer this, or backend logic + email service integration._
*   **User Profile Editing:**
    *   Allow users to edit basic profile information (e.g., name).
*   **AI Chatbot Integration Strategy & Initial Implementation:**
    *   **Decision:** Determine the integration method for `ai-farming-chatbot/` (e.g., embedded iframe in FarmPower, link to a separate site, direct API integration).
    *   **Clarify AI Model:** Confirm whether to use Google's Generative AI or ChatGPT API, and ensure API keys are configured.
    *   **Initial Integration:** Implement the chosen basic integration method so users can access the chatbot.

## Phase 2: Expanding Core Functionality (Aligned with Development Roadmap)

This phase focuses on building out more features from the `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, particularly those marked for "Phase 1" completion.

### 2.1. Enhance Marketplaces
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Implement more robust search (e.g., by location, year, price range) and filtering options for the Equipment Marketplace.
*   **Favorite/Save Listings:** Allow users to save or "favorite" tractor listings they are interested in.
*   **Parts Marketplace - Full Implementation:** If not included in MVP, fully develop the Parts Marketplace with CRUD operations for part listings, similar to the Equipment Marketplace.

### 2.2. Develop GPS Tracking & Field Planning Features
*   **Mapbox Integration:** Integrate Mapbox for displaying fields and equipment.
*   **Field Boundary Drawing:** Allow farmers to draw or define field boundaries on a map.
*   **Basic Equipment Location Tracking:** (If feasible with available data/hardware) Show the last known location of registered equipment.

### 2.3. Improve Crop Calculator & Management
*   **Historical Data Tracking:** Allow the crop calculator to save and display historical calculation data.
*   **Market Price Integration (Basic):** Explore ways to pull in indicative market prices for common crops (could be manual input initially or a simple API).
*   **Detailed Crop Management:** Expand beyond basic field-crop association to track planting dates, expected harvest, yields, etc., as per backend models.

### 2.4. Enhance Communication Features
*   **Real-time Chat (Basic):** Begin implementation of a basic real-time user-to-user messaging system (WebSockets, leveraging Supabase Realtime if applicable, or backend's socket capabilities).
*   **Notification System Enhancements:** Improve the existing notification system with more types of notifications and better UI.

## Phase 3: Maturing the Platform

### 3.1. Technical Debt Reduction & Quality Assurance
*   **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
    *   Write unit tests for backend services and frontend components.
    *   Implement integration tests for key user flows.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement structured logging across services and set up monitoring/alerting for critical system health indicators.
*   **Security Hardening:** Conduct a security review, implement measures like rate limiting (if not fully done), input validation, and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **API Documentation:** Ensure `farmpower_backend_v2/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` is consistently updated and accurate. Consider auto-generating API docs (e.g., from FastAPI's OpenAPI schema).

### 3.2. Advanced Features & User Experience
*   **Admin Panel Development:** Create a functional frontend for the admin operations already present in the backend API (user management, content moderation).
*   **Refine User Roles & Permissions:** Implement more granular roles if needed (e.g., farmer, dealer, service provider, admin) and enforce permissions consistently.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure all aspects of the platform are fully mobile-responsive.
*   **Advanced AI Chatbot Features:** Enhance the chatbot with context-aware responses, farming-specific knowledge base training, etc.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Documentation:** Continuously update all relevant documentation (`README.md` files, architecture diagrams, user guides).
*   **Code Cleanup:** Address the roles of potentially deprecated/unused components (`backend/`, `farmpower_marketplace/`, alternative frontend servers in `FARMPOWER/`) by either integrating, refactoring, or removing them.
*   **User Experience (UX) Refinement:** Continuously gather user feedback and iterate on the UI/UX design for better usability and engagement.

These next steps provide a structured approach to evolving the FarmPower platform beyond its MVP stage, balancing feature development with technical improvements and quality assurance. Prioritization within these phases should be flexible based on user feedback, business goals, and resource availability.
